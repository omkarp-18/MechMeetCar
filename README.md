🚗 MechMeetCar

A Freelancing Platform Connecting Vehicle Owners with Local Mechanics

📌 Overview

MechMeetCar is a location-based freelancing platform designed to connect vehicle owners with nearby verified mechanics for on-demand vehicle services such as repairs, servicing, and emergency breakdown assistance.

The platform simplifies the traditional mechanic discovery process by providing real-time booking, transparent communication, and trust-based ratings — bringing structure to an otherwise unorganized service ecosystem.

🎯 Problem Statement

Vehicle owners often face challenges such as:

Difficulty finding reliable mechanics quickly

Lack of transparency in pricing and service quality

No real-time tracking or job status updates

Poor trust and accountability mechanisms

MechMeetCar addresses these issues by offering a centralized, tech-driven solution.

💡 Solution

MechMeetCar acts as a two-sided marketplace:

Customers request vehicle services.

Mechanics (freelancers) accept jobs based on proximity, skills, and availability.

The platform ensures faster service delivery, improved trust, and better earning opportunities for mechanics.
